         <p><span class="purpleText">Wild Circus </span> 
        was born in 1932 in England, when three friends - Harold, Louis and Marsha - decided to create their own circus with their own rules. This is not a love triangle between a woman and two men as you wish (even though Marsha and Harold finally got married five years later). This is a love story between three people and the circus.<br></br>
       
        At this very moment, when they took the oath, our three friends swore to God to make us dream big and small. Since then, they travelled around the world, sharing their art.</p> 

         <p>Clowns, jugglers, acrobats, tamers, dancers and much more... Today they are a team of passionate artists. And maybe have you heard about our 
          <span class="greenText">Greatest Showman</span>?
          </p>
      
         <p>London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, Sydney, Toronto, Beijing... are some of the great cities they performed in.</p>
      
         <p>This is not a coincidence if 87 years later
           <span class="orangeText"> Wild Circus </span> is still one of the most covoted circus in the world. Thanks to the love and energy they invest in their shows they keep on making us dream everyday.
